## Deployment

This application can be easily deployed using GitHub Pages.

1.  **Ensure your repository is on GitHub.**
2.  **Main Application File:** The main application is `winter3d/winter6.html`. A root `index.html` file is included, which automatically redirects to `winter3d/winter6.html`.
3.  **GitHub Pages Configuration:**
    *   Go to your repository on GitHub.
    *   Click on "Settings".
    *   Navigate to the "Pages" section in the left sidebar.
    *   Under "Build and deployment", for "Source", select "Deploy from a branch".
    *   Under "Branch", select your main branch (e.g., `main` or `master`) and the folder as `/ (root)`.
    *   Click "Save".
4.  **Accessing Your Site:** GitHub Pages will build and deploy your site. After a few moments, it should be available at `https://<your-username>.github.io/<your-repository-name>/`.

**Note:** The application uses an overlay that requires a user click to start the experience and enable audio. This is a common practice for web applications with audio content.
